This is a reading list about research and technology on the usage of choreographies (and global descriptions of communications in general) for the programming of concurrent systems.

Pull requests are welcome. Please include a (very) short description of what the paper presents.

# Choreographic Programming (Choreographies as Programs)

Choreographic Programming is a development methodology where choreographies are used as high-level programs, from which executable distributed implementations can be compiled.


# Software Verification (Choreographies as Types)

Models and frameworks that use choreographies as protocol descriptions, for checking the communication behaviour of processes before or during execution time.
